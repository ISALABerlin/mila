been held several times in Australia and New Zealand in 2006–2008.
It covers statistical methods that are currently feasible in practice and available in public
domain software. Some of these techniques are well established in the applications literature,
while some are very recent developments.
The workshop uses the statistical package R and is based on spatstat, an add-on library
for R for the analysis of spatial data.
Topics covered include:  statistical formulation and methodological issues;  data input
and handling; R concepts such as classes and methods; nonparametric intensity estimates;
goodness-of-ﬁt testing for Complete Spatial Randomness; maximum likelihood inference for
Poisson processes; model validation for Poisson processes; distance methods and summary
functions such as Ripley’s K function; non-Poisson point process models; simulation tech-
niques; ﬁtting models using summary statistics; Gibbs point process models; ﬁtting Gibbs
models; simulating Gibbs models; validating Gibbs models; multitype and marked point pat-
terns; exploratory analysis of marked point patterns; multitype Poisson process models and
maximum likelihood inference; multitype Gibbs process models and maximum pseudolikeli-
hood; and line segment data.},

"Methods for the selection of the bandwidth of kernel smoothers in a general setting are given by Silverman (1986). In the context of spatial analysis, a few proposals have been made so far, but it is not clear how to choose an optimal value for the bandwidth in the general case. It seems reasonable to use several values depending on the process under consideration, and choose a value that seems plausible." (Bivand et al 2008:173)

	abstract = {Good science must be clearly transparent in its theories, models and experiments. Earlier David Tilman drew attention to the fact that ecologists investigate interspecific competition phenomenologically, rather than mechanistically. To create a mechanistic model of a complex dynamic system we need to logically describe interactions of its subsystems which lead to emergence of new properties on the macro-level. There are black-box, grey-box and white-box models of complex systems. Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such non-transparent model. A white-box model of a complex system has ?transparent walls? and directly shows underlined mechanistic mechanisms ? all events at micro-, meso- and macro- levels of the modeled dynamic system are directly visible at all stages. Grey-box models are intermediate. Basic ecological models are of black-box type, e.g. Malthusian, Verhulst, Lotka-Volterra models. These models are not individual-based and cannot show features of local interactions of individuals of competing species. That is why they principally cannot provide a mechanistic insight into interspecific competition. To create a white-box model we need а physical theory of the object domain and its intrinsic axiomatic system. On the basis of axiomatic system there is a possibility to logically generate a new knowledge by logical deterministic cellular automata. Understanding of biodiversity mechanisms is the global research priority. Only knowledge of mechanisms of interspecific interactions can allow us to efficiently operate in the field of biodiversity conservation. Obviously that such knowledge must be based on mechanistic models of species coexistence. In order to create a serviceable theory of biodiversity it is necessary to renew attempts to create a basic mechanistic model of species coexistence. But the question arises: Why ecological modelers prefer to use the heaviest black-box mathematical methods which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems in principle, and why they do not use simple and long-known pure logical deterministic cellular automata, which easily can produce white-box models and directly generate clear mechanistic insights into dynamics of complex systems?},

	abstract = {This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with R's `base' graphics and the popular
graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the
R command line would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction to
R' type tutorial, such as "A (very) short introduction to R" (Torfs and Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically
inclined "Short introduction to R" (Harris, 2012).
Building on such background material, the following set of exercises is concerned with specific functions for spatial
data and visualisation. It is divided into five parts:
*Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and preparing for the tutorial
*Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions in R
*Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping and spatial joins
*Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing beautiful maps quickly
*Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of resources for furthering your skills
An up-to-date version of this tutorial is maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and
the entire tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are
entirely reproducible.
Suggested improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original home to ensure its
longevity. The tutorial was developed for a series of Short Courses put on by the National Centre for Research Methods, via the TALISMAN node (see geotalisman.org).},

	abstract = {Understand How to Analyze and Interpret Information in Ecological Point Patterns  Although numerous statistical methods for analyzing spatial point patterns have been available for several decades, they haven’t been extensively applied in an ecological context. Addressing this gap, Handbook of Spatial Point-Pattern Analysis in Ecology shows how the techniques of point-pattern analysis are useful for tackling ecological problems. Within an ecological framework, the book guides readers through a variety of methods for different data types and aids in the interpretation of the results obtained by point-pattern analysis.   Ideal for empirical ecologists who want to avoid advanced theoretical literature, the book covers statistical techniques for analyzing and interpreting the information contained in ecological patterns. It presents methods used to extract information hidden in spatial point-pattern data that may point to the underlying processes. The authors focus on point processes and null models that have proven their immediate utility for broad ecological applications, such as cluster processes.  Along with the techniques, the handbook provides a comprehensive selection of real-world examples. Most of the examples are analyzed using Programita, a continuously updated software package based on the authors’ many years of teaching and collaborative research in ecological point-pattern analysis. Programita is tailored to meet the needs of real-world applications in ecology. The software and a manual are available online.},

	abstract = {A large number of methods for the analysis of point pattern data have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields. First-order statistics describe large-scale variation in the intensity of points in a study region, whereas second-order characteristics are summary statistics of all point-to-point distances in a mapped area and offer the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns. Second-order analysis based on Ripley's K-function is increasingly used in ecology to characterize spatial patterns and to develop hypothesis on underlying processes; however, the full range of available methods has seldomly been applied by ecologists. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in second-order analysis to help in the choice of appropriate methods and to point to practical difficulties and pitfalls. We review (1) methods for analytical and numerical implementation of two complementary second-order statistics, Ripley's K and the O-ring statistic, (2) methods for edge correction, (3) methods to account for first-order effects (i.e. heterogeneity) of univariate patterns, and (4) a variety of useful standard and non-standard null models for univariate and bivariate patterns. For illustrative purpose, we analyze examples that deal with non-homogeneous univariate point patterns. We demonstrate that large-scale heterogeneity of a point-pattern biases Ripley's K-function at smaller scales. This bias is difficult to detect without explicitly testing for homogeneity, but we show that it can be removed when applying methods that account for first-order effects. We synthesize our review in a number of step-by-step recommendations that guide the reader through the selection of appropriate methods and we provide a software program that implements most of the methods reviewed and developed here.},
